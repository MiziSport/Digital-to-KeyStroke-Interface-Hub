# Digital-to-KeyStroke-Interface-Hub

Introduction: The request for this project comes from the Afifah & Yuen group, who are working towards fully automating their project. They require a device capable of receiving signals from sensors and robots and transmitting them as keyboard inputs to a PC. This is necessary for the testXpert Software to run automatically without manual intervention. However, a challenge arises because the software is closed-source and does not support communication with PLCs. To address this issue, Arduino technology can be utilized to convert the 24V signals into keyboard inputs through UART communication.

Objective: To fully automated Quality Control process of materials tensile testing for needle cappillary (FEP and PUR).
